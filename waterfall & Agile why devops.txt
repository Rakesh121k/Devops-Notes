Waterfall vs Agile Model
--------------------------
            Waterfall Model

Analysis-->Plan-->Design-->Build-->Test-->Deploy

            Agile Model

Analysis-->Plan-->Design-->Build-->Test-->Deploy

=>Here stages or process are same, But in Agile it is segregated or divided into iterations

Limitations of Agile
---------------------
Developer Team                                              Operations Team
--------------                                              ---------------
=>Code works fine in my laptop                              =>There is some problem with the code it does not work in production

wants change                                                  wants stability
=>By this there is collaboration or communication gap b/w two teams
So Solution is Devops
combination of Development and Operations

Development without Devops culture
------------------------------------
=>Release and deploy mismatch
=>Unpredictable issues
=>Blame game
=>Lack of Monitoring

Development with Devops culture
------------------------------------
=>Streamlined Deliveries
=>Teamwork in collaboration
=>Continuous monitoring and Feedback

What needs to be done at development
--------------------------------------
=>Use system with little or no waiting time
=>Use system with updated code

What needs to be done at operations
--------------------------------------
=>System should up and running most of the time
=>System required for easy administration
=>Effective monitoring and feedbacks system should be established

What exactly is Devops in Reallife
-----------------------------------
Plan-->Code-->Build-->Test-->Release-->Deploy-->Operate-->Monitor

What is Devops
---------------
Devops is a practice that allows a single team to manage the entire application development life cycle that is development,testing,deployment and monitoring

Plan- Jira tool
Code- Git,Eclipse
Build- Jenkins,Maven
Test- Selenium, Junit
Releases- Bamboo
Deploy - AWS,Ansible
Operate- Nagios
Monitor - Splunk

What Devops does do
---------------------
=>Integrates developers and operations team
=>Improves collaboration and productivity
=>Automating infrastructure
=>Automating workflows
=>Continuous measuring application performance
